Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
I am hoping for 100! I believe the workload was fairly distributed between me and my partner Jacob.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
I believe my work in the class is sufficient for an A. I enjoyed the class a ton and I learned so much about
web development and how I can apply it to my own work. The reason I took this class was to gain familiarity with web
design so I could help build the Lloyd website. It was a huge success too; I integrated several APIs into the website
and the UI looks amazing. Assignment-wise, I was also able to complete every assignment on time and ensured they passed the
validators on canvas. I also engaged in office hours, discord, and with my friends when any of us had questions. 

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
I want to know how well I followed standard HTML, CSS, and javascript conventions

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
I hope you are having a great day

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
Yeah, you can share/modify my project however you want. You can cite me by name, but you don't have to. I'm 
thankful for everything I learned.
